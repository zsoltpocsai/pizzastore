# Pizza Store

It's kind of a pizza store site, but I would rather call it as my first take on PHP (and making websites at all) as a school task.
At the time of creation I had no idea about MVC or even databases so it has a primitive approach to store information in text files on the server side.

I deployed it on a Heroku server, so you can take a look [here](http://warm-oasis-31275.herokuapp.com/).
